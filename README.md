# Groundswell Technical Challenge

## Description
The page should allow up to ten letters of the alphabet to be entered into a text input field. It also has a display button, named Calculate, which when clicked will perform the following functionality:

- Translate each alphabetic character entered as follows â€“ a=1, b=2, c=3, and so on to z=26
- Add the numeric values of each translated character together and display the result on the page
- Check whether the result is a prime number or not and display some text saying which it is

Example 1:
Input: aaa
Output: 3 is a prime number

Example 2:
Input: abc
Output: 6 is not a prime number

Example 3:
Input: azb
Output: 29 is a prime number
